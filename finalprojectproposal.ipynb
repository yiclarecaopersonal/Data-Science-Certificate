So my final project will continue my previous research to fine tune the unsupervised modeling to gain better insights into the customer behavior in the credit card suage. \n\nThe public dataset I will be use is from Kaggle:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata\n\nFollowing is the Data Dictionary for Credit Card dataset :-\n\nCUSTID : Identification of Credit Card holder (Categorical)\nBALANCE : Balance amount left in their account to make purchases (\nBALANCEFREQUENCY : How frequently the Balance is updated, score between 0 and 1 (1 = frequently updated, 0 = not frequently updated)\nPURCHASES : Amount of purchases made from account\nONEOFFPURCHASES : Maximum purchase amount done in one-go\nINSTALLMENTSPURCHASES : Amount of purchase done in installment\nCASHADVANCE : Cash in advance given by the user\nPURCHASESFREQUENCY : How frequently the Purchases are being made, score between 0 and 1 (1 = frequently purchased, 0 = not frequently purchased)\nONEOFFPURCHASESFREQUENCY : How frequently Purchases are happening in one-go (1 = frequently purchased, 0 = not frequently purchased)\nPURCHASESINSTALLMENTSFREQUENCY : How frequently purchases in installments are being done (1 = frequently done, 0 = not frequently done)\nCASHADVANCEFREQUENCY : How frequently the cash in advance being paid\nCASHADVANCETRX : Number of Transactions made with \"Cash in Advanced\"\nPURCHASESTRX : Numbe of purchase transactions made\nCREDITLIMIT : Limit of Credit Card for user\nPAYMENTS : Amount of Payment done by user\nMINIMUM_PAYMENTS : Minimum amount of payments made by user\nPRCFULLPAYMENT : Percent of full payment paid by user\nTENURE : Tenure of credit card service for user\n\nBefore applying models, I will be first explore the dataset, norm/scale the data and filling the nulls.\n\nIn the last capstone, I have compared KMeans and DBSCAN methods and the results indicated that KMeans model did a better job in clustering. So I will continue tuning the KMeans model with varous parameters. Also in the last project, I appliled KMeans method on the PCA reduced dataset. So I will this time turning the PCA parameters to see how I can archive the best clustering of the customer groups.\n\nThe main challenge I can is the feature correlations and subtle difference in the customer behaiver. So this project I will reevaluate the number of groups that will provide a meanful insight into the credit usuage patterns.\n\nCustomer segmentation is one of the major market targetting areas that all finetechs are utilizing from approval/reject of credit applications, increase/decrease of credit limits, customer profiling for specific products, to mobile apps pop ups that interests customers.\nSo I am hoping to build a model which can help in our bank's customer satisfication and increase bank's profits. \n","metadata":{}}]}
